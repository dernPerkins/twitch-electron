# twitch-electron
Personal version of what a twitch electron app would look like for  very simple viewing and chatting.

# Building / Developing
MAC OS - requires MAMP and with a LowTwitch folder in the htdocs. Place a index.html inside of that, nothing else needed just a local redirect that the token can authorize with for the redirecturi.
